hello world


I am inside my house now. Outside, sounds are attenuated by the insulation. I hear a dripping faucet and the ticking of my cuckoo clock. They combine and are joined by the refrigerator. The planes from Palomar Airport dwindle in through the furnace openings.

I have listened to many refrigerators. There is often a flickering between the sixth and seventh harmonic. Once, while in the process of drinking ouzo with David, Bob, and Orville, a refrigerator sent its harmonics out to surround my head with circles, ellipses, and figure-eights.
